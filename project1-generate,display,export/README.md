# Project 1: Generate, Display & Export Source Generating Sine Waves

This is basically a HelloWorld project for Simulink. The goal of this project is to understand basic simulink operations, how to tune model parameters and wave frequencies, how to use summation, how to use scope, and how to use simulink output in matlab.
